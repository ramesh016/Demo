Heyyyy , I created this sudoku file and edited this on giut hub , 
I remind you edited this on git hub not on my local computer,. mind this
Now , how to get changes done in my local computer or local reposoitory same as my remote repo(git hub
)
ans:simply type the command git pull origin master , then all the changes done on git gets updated on your local repo.


Added this line from my local computer and now , how to get updated in my remote repo?
ans : I don't know , i will try and if everything goes well i write the answer in to this file from git hub, stay tuned.


heyy am here(remote repo):
so whenever you edit something form local repo or local computer you have to 
1)add file 
2)commit file 
3)push file 
then only it gets updated on remote repo
